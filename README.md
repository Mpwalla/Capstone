Data for this project can be found at: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales)

Project objective: The project focuses on looking at video game sales  from the 1970s to 2023

Insights
the major insights that I saw was that consoles are the primary sellers of games with action and racing genres  leading  in Genres. North America is the leading area of total gamers but the data does not take a look at places like China,  I will need to find and incorporate data  into this to get a deeper look.  I would also like to try and find good mobile game sale data  to add into this.
What action does it inspire
I feel this  can help  lead Shareholders and game developers into thinking about the past and what were some of the titles and publishers that were really doing well
to help shape  the future decisions about the games they want to make.
